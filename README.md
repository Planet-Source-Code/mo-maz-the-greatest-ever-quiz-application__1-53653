## The Greatest Ever Quiz Application


</div>

### Description

Well this program is regarded as the best quiz program because it presents two types of questions to the users by clicking next and previous buttons.  You have to login in order to do the quiz. I did not do the quiz on my own, I would like to thank Sachin Palewar (a member here) for the timer, Madhur Namdev (also a member) for the interface of the Question Form, Dave Applegate (a VBCity member) for contributing in supplying a significant amount of code, especially for the OO code, Catejan D’Souza (a member here) for the Results Form, and Richard Jackson – for the interface of the Login Form and Rafay Mansoor for the Register Form. I acknowledged the original authors so I made sure that the application was not written by me. Many thanks you all people for making it possible. I hope someone uses my code to improve it. It will also help for their projects at school or uni.
